### Background

This sample app was created following the instructions here: https://github.com/Esri/angular-cli-esri-map. Please spend some time getting comfortable with those instructions.

To support a multi-app repository for teaching purposes, several Angular CLI-generated files from this sample app were either deleted or moved to the parent directory of this repository. You do not need to concern yourself with this when generating new Angular apps of your own.
